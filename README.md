# Renal Health Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of chronic kidney disease (CKD) using machine learning techniques. The dataset was collected over a 2-month period in India and comprises 25 features such as red blood cell count, white blood cell count, etc. The target variable is 'classification', which can be either 'ckd' (chronic kidney disease) or 'notckd'. We have utilized various machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, bagging, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for prediction.

## Key Components

### 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
- Gathered data over a 2-month period in India, comprising 25 features related to kidney health.
- Preprocessed the data to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale features.

### 2. Model Training and Evaluation
- Trained multiple machine learning models including logistic regression, decision trees, bagging, random forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, KNN, and SVM.
- Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 3. Result Analysis
- Achieved a high accuracy of 99% with the random forest model in predicting chronic kidney disease.
- Analyzed feature importance to understand the factors contributing to the prediction.
